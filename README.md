# PID---flow-of-liquid-in-heater
A web application using Python with Dash framework to simulate flow of liquid in flow heater.

The presented mathematical model of the PID controller allows to set the desired water temperature and heater parameters.

Controlled variable of the system is the voltage of the heater (heating liquid, which is water). 
Charts of temperature, control signal, voltage and power over time are displayed. 
Two independent areas for entering parameters allow to display and compare charts for different input data.

In addition, indicators of the quality of regulation are calculated.
